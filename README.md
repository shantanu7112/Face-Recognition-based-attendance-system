# Face-Recognition-based-attendance-system
This project is a facial recognition attendance system implemented using OpenCV and Python. It consists of four components:

* c1_findfacemeasure: This component detects faces in images, extracts facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and calculates the distances between these features. It saves the face regions and the calculated distances in a CSV file.

* c2_CreateImages: This component takes the face regions saved by the previous component and creates a new image by arranging them in a grid pattern. The output image is saved as "output_image.bmp".

* c3_findattendance: This component takes an input image, detects faces, extracts facial features, and compares the distances between these features with the distances saved in the CSV file generated by the first component. It then matches the face with the closest match from the CSV file and records the attendance in a separate CSV file named "attendance.csv". The attendance sheet is displayed with the recognized names overlaid on the faces in the input image.

* c4_mail: This component sends an email with the attendance sheet attached as a CSV file to a specified email address. It uses the SMTP protocol and requires the sender's and receiver's email addresses.

Requirements
* Python (version 3.6 or above)
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
